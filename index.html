        <p class="detailed-info">
          I am a polished writer, rookie designer, and developer(in making).
          Every social post, campaign, website, and application is a story being
          told to an audience. And...I love a good story. I taught myself
          graphic design, UI/UX, and Front-end coding, just so I could
          understand and enjoy every such story from every perpective. In my 5+
          years of experience I have worked on brands across categories of FMCG,
          Hospitality, BSFI and many more!
